Ideas:
* consider non-linear models.
* multiple models
* one-hot encode conditions.

Done:
* identify outliers and remove them.
* remove some features
* write a custom estimator so that you can adjust its parameters.
* aggregate some features.
* decompose some highly correlated features, do clustering on some features.
* use knn to impute missing values.
* different methods of normalizing some things.
* correct features for their skew, consider better ways to standardize features
* consider seasonal effects

Age:
  - YearBuilt: could convert to an age.
  - YearRemodAdd: May one-hot encode this to record the fact that the home was re-modeled.
  - MoSold:
  - YrSold: may want to keep both of these because market swings and seasonal affects can be dramatic.  Combine
    the two though, into a total months.  Maybe one-hot encode a season though, or apply like a sinusoidal curve
    to it.
Location: can incorporate some information from conditions here, like if it is on a cul-de-sac, arterial street, feeder street, etc.

Sale: should definitely one-hot encode these things

  - Condition1 and Condition2:
    - might want to combine these two conditions and one-hot encode them.
    - Can make one category for railroad proximity, but it may be non-linear
