# 5. There is a clear exponential trend in the price with area
# 6. One easy way to eliminate outliers is to remove rows with a total area over 7000 square feet.

#    that there are more homes sold in the summer.
# 8. The relation of price and overall quality seems to be exponential just slightly.
